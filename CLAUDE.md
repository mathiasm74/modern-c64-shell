# C64 Shell ROM

A ROM-resident command shell for the Commodore 64, designed to replace the stock BASIC + KERNAL combination with a modern command-line interface. Distributed as a 16KB ROM image suitable for flashing to a OneROM, EasyFlash, or burned EPROM.

## Goals

- Boot directly into a modern shell instead of BASIC's READY prompt.
- Provide a command-line interface with line editing, history, and tab completion.
- Built-in fast loader (Epyx-compatible) for use with stock 1541, SD2IEC, Pi1541, Meatloaf, and 1541 Ultimate.
- File browser and directory navigation for IEC devices.
- Machine language monitor.
- Preserve standard KERNAL entry points so existing machine-language software still works.
- No BASIC interpreter. BASIC programs cannot be run. This is a deliberate tradeoff to reclaim 8KB of ROM space.

## Non-goals

- Running BASIC programs. Use a different ROM slot for that.
- Tape support. The 1530 datasette is not supported; this space is reclaimed.
- GUI or graphics modes. Text only.

## Target hardware

- Commodore 64 (PAL and NTSC).
- Tested in VICE (x64sc) with true drive emulation.
- Final hardware target: OneROM with this image as one of its selectable banks.

## Toolchain

- **cc65 suite** (ca65, cc65, ld65) for assembly and C compilation. Version 2.19 or later.
- **VICE** (x64sc specifically) for emulation and testing. Version 3.7 or later.
- **Python 3** for the test harness.
- **GNU Make** as the build driver.

All tools must be on PATH. Verify with `make check-tools`.

## Build

```
make            # builds build/kernal.bin and build/basic.bin
make test       # builds and runs the test suite
make run        # builds and launches VICE with the ROM
make clean      # removes build artifacts
```

The build produces two 8KB binaries that together form the 16KB ROM:
- `build/kernal.bin` maps to $E000-$FFFF.
- `build/basic.bin` maps to $A000-$BFFF (despite the name, this is not BASIC; it's the shell code).

For OneROM flashing, the two are concatenated: `cat build/basic.bin build/kernal.bin > build/rom16k.bin`.

## Memory map (planned)

| Range         | Contents                          |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| $0000-$0001   | Processor port (standard)         |
| $0002-$00FF   | Zero page (shell working storage) |
| $0100-$01FF   | Hardware stack                    |
| $0200-$03FF   | KERNAL/shell working memory       |
| $0400-$07FF   | Screen RAM                        |
| $0800-$9FFF   | User RAM (loaded programs)        |
| $A000-$BFFF   | Shell code ROM (cc65 output)      |
| $C000-$CFFF   | User RAM                          |
| $D000-$DFFF   | I/O (VIC-II, SID, CIA, color RAM) |
| $E000-$FFFF   | KERNAL ROM (init, IRQ, stubs)     |

## Conventions

### Code organization

- **Hardware setup, IRQ handler, and KERNAL entry points are in assembly** in `src/*.s`. These are timing-sensitive or need fixed addresses.
- **Shell logic, parser, and command implementations are in C** in `src/*.c` and `src/commands/`.
- **Fast loader is in assembly** in `src/fastload.s`. Timing matters too much for C.
- C code calls assembly via standard cc65 calling conventions. Assembly that needs to be called from C is declared with `.export _name` and accessed in C as `name()`.

### KERNAL entry points

Standard KERNAL routines must exist at their published addresses for compatibility:

| Address | Routine  | Purpose                          |
|---------|----------|----------------------------------|
| $FFD2   | CHROUT   | Print character in A             |
| $FFE4   | GETIN    | Read character (non-blocking)    |
| $FFCF   | CHRIN    | Read character (blocking)        |
| $FFBA   | SETLFS   | Set logical file params          |
| $FFBD   | SETNAM   | Set filename                     |
| $FFC0   | OPEN     | Open file                        |
| $FFC3   | CLOSE    | Close file                       |
| $FFC6   | CHKIN    | Set input channel                |
| $FFC9   | CHKOUT   | Set output channel               |
| $FFCC   | CLRCHN   | Restore default channels         |
| $FFD5   | LOAD     | Load file                        |
| $FFD8   | SAVE     | Save file                        |

These are JMPs to implementations elsewhere in the ROM. Defined in `src/kernal_stubs.s`.

### Zero page

The C64 normally reserves $00-$8F for BASIC and $90-$FF for KERNAL. Since we have no BASIC, $00-$8F is available to the shell. cc65 uses $02-$1F by default for its pseudo-registers; configure this in `cfg/rom.cfg`.

Reserve $90-$FF for KERNAL working storage and keep it compatible with documented usage so loaded programs that poke around in zero page don't break.

### Naming

- Assembly labels: lowercase with underscores, e.g. `init_vic`, `scan_keyboard`.
- C functions: lowercase with underscores, e.g. `parse_command`, `cmd_ls`.
- Constants in assembly: uppercase, e.g. `SCREEN_RAM = $0400`.
- Command handlers in C: `cmd_<name>`, e.g. `cmd_help`, `cmd_load`.

### Commits

Commit after every passing test. Each commit should leave `make test` green. Use short imperative subject lines: "add CHROUT entry point", "implement ls command", not "Added the CHROUT entry point".

## Testing

The test harness in `test/` drives VICE via the remote monitor protocol. Each test:

1. Builds the ROM.
2. Launches `x64sc` headless with `-remotemonitor -kernal build/kernal.bin -basic build/basic.bin`.
3. Connects to the monitor TCP socket (default port 6502).
4. Performs test actions: inject keystrokes, read memory, check screen contents.
5. Cleanly shuts down VICE.
6. Exits 0 on success, nonzero on failure.

Screen memory at $0400-$07E7 contains C64 *screen codes* (display codes), which are not the same as PETSCII (e.g. 'A' is PETSCII $41 but screen code $01). Test helpers should decode screen codes to ASCII for assertions; see `screencode_to_ascii` in `test/smoke_test.py`.

When adding a new feature, add a test that exercises it. The test suite is the safety net that lets us refactor confidently.

## Working with this codebase

- The reset vector at $FFFC/$FFFD must point to the init code in `reset.s`. Don't move this without updating the linker config.
- The IRQ vector at $FFFE/$FFFF must point to the IRQ handler in `irq.s`.
- When implementing a new command, add it to the dispatch table in `src/shell.c` and create a handler in the appropriate `src/commands/*.c` file.
- When adding a KERNAL entry point, update both `src/kernal_stubs.s` and the table in this document.
- Run `make test` before committing. If tests fail, fix them or mark them as expected failures with a comment explaining why.
- Prefer adding new tests over modifying existing ones. Existing tests document expected behavior; changing them silently can hide regressions.

## Current phase

Phase 0: Toolchain setup. Goal is to produce two 8KB binaries from a trivial source tree, verify VICE boots them without crashing, and have `make test` pass a smoke test.

See `PLAN.md` for the full phased plan.
